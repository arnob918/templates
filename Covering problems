Maximum Independent Set(Bipartite):
    -Largest set of nodes which do not have any edge between them.
    -sol: V-(MaxMatching)
    
Minimum Vertex Cover(Bipartite):
    -Smallest set of nodes to cover all the edges
    -sol: MaxMatching
    
Minimum Edge Cover(General graph):
    -Smallest set of edges to cover all the nodes
    -sol: V-(MaxMatching) (if edge cover exists, does not exit for isolated nodes)
    
Minimum Path Cover(Vertex disjoint) DAG:
    -Minimum number of vertex disjoint paths that visit all the nodes
    -sol: make a bipartite graph using same nodes in two sides, one side is "from" other is "to", add edges from "from" to "to", then ans
          is V-(MaxMatching)
    
Minimum Path Cover(Vertex Not Disjoint) General graph:
    -Minimum number of paths that visit all the nodes
    -sol: make a bipartite graph using same nodes in two sides, one side is "from" other is "to",add one edge from "from a" to "to b" if
          b is reachable from a using one or more edge, then ans is V-(MaxMatching)
